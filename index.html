      <h5>     We aim to develop our students academically, socially, and morally, so that they leave the institution as independent, cooperative, responsible, and creative young individuals, positively contributing to society.
We believe that this can be achieved in the following ways.
• By providing opportunities for individuals to develop their abilities to appropriate levels.
• By providing effective guidance which will enable individuals to review their progress and to set targets for themselves.
• By nurturing self-esteem and encouraging our students to value themselves.
• By encouraging respect for other people and an awareness of their needs.
• By encouraging achievement and rewarding success.
• By providing a varied programme of extracurricular activities.
